# CPii

CPii was an failed atempt to reinvent the wheel.
I was trying to get a basic copy command to show up a percentage about how is it going. As a native windows user, sometimes I find it hard to notice when a command is taking a long time to process or it's just stuck.

Anyways, a friend of mine told me about rsync
`rsync -a --info=progress2 src dest` does exactly what I wanted to achieve.
